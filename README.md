## Backend
The backend is implemented as a RESTful API using Java and Spring Boot.

### Key features:
- Role-based access control (Admin, Employee, Client)
- Secure authentication using JWT and OAuth2
- Protected REST endpoints with Spring Security
- User, order, and service management
- AI-powered service advisory module (OpenAI API integration)
- Clean layered architecture (controllers, services, repositories)

### Backend tech stack:
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- JWT & OAuth2
- PostgreSQL
- Maven

---

## Frontend
The frontend is implemented as a single-page application using React.

### Frontend responsibilities:
- User authentication and authorization
- Service browsing and booking
- Order management and status tracking
